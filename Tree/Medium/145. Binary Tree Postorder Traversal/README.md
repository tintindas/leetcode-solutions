# 145. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

## Main Concept

**Postorder Tree Traversal** - In a postorder traversal we process the left and right subtrees first and then the root of the tree.

## Solution Explained

We process the left and right subtrees before we add the value of the node to our answer array.
