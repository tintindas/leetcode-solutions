# 144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

## Main Concept

**Preorder Tree Traversal** - In a preorder traversal of the tree we process the root first and then the left and right subtrees.

## Solution Explained

We add the value of the root to our answer array and then make recursive calls for the left and right subtrees.
