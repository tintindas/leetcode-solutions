# 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

## Solution Explained

We achieve a inorder traversal of a binary tree by recursively making the call for the left subtree first then processing the root and then making a call for the right subtree.
