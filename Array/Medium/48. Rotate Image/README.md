# 48. Rotate Image

## Problem Statement

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

## Solution Explained

To rotate a matrix by 90 degree clockwise we just form the transpose of the matrix and then reverse the transpose of the matrix row wise.
