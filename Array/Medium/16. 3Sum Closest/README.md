# 16. 3Sum Closest

## Problem Statement

Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

## Solution Explained

Similar to [3Sum](../15.%203Sum).

We modify 3Sum to track the difference from target rather than returning a boolean.
