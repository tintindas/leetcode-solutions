# 283. Move Zeroes

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

## Solution Explained

Moving all the zeroes to the end is the same as moving all the non-zero elements to the front.
